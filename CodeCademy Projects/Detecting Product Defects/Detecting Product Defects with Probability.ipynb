    "12. Congratulations! At this point, you have now explored the Poisson distribution and even worked with some simulated data. We have a couple of extra tasks if you would like an extra challenge. Let’s say we want to know how many defects in a given day would put us in the 90th percentile of the Poisson(7) distribution. One way we could calculate this is by using the following method: `stats.poisson.ppf(percentile, lambda)` where `percentile` is equal to the desired percentile (a decimal between 0 and 1), and lambda is the lambda parameter of the Poisson distribution. This function is essentially the inverse of the CDF. Use this method to calculate and print the number of defects that would put us in the 90th percentile for a given day. In other words, on 90% of days, we will observe fewer defects than this number."
